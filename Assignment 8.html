    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>In West Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days. Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool, and shooting some b-ball outside of the school.
            When a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my Mom got scared, and said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
